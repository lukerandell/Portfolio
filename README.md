# Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio showcasing my projects as an Undergraduate studying Agricultural Engineering.

Interests:
- Mechanical Design
- Automation
- Robotics
- Eletronics
- Agriculture

Skills:
- CAD (SolidWorks, Onshape)
- FEA and CFD (ANSYS Discovery)
- Material Selection (ANSYS Granta)
- Data Managemet (MATLAB, Microsoft Excel
- Programming (Python, Flowcode)


Overview of my Projects:
1. Automatic Watering System:

   As my A-Level computer science project, I created a functioning watering system using a RaspberryPi and connected sensors. The system used inputs from light level, soil moisture and local weather forecasts to prevent overwatering and underwatering. The system controlled a submursible pump in a water container for use during hosepipe bans.
   Skills Developed:
     - Programming - Python, HTML, SQL, API Requests
     - RaspberryPi
     - Basic Eletronics - Sensors and Components

3. Drone Arm Design:
   
   As my 1st Year Design Project, I designed and tested drone arms using additive manufacturing. The task was to design strong drone arms while maintaining lower weights for autonomous flight. Used a Tensile Testing machine for more accurate FEA simulations and used CFD to design more aerodynamic components. 
   Skills Developed:
   - CAD - SolidWorks
   - FEA and CFD - ANSYS Discovery
   - Material Testing - ANSYS Granta, Universal Tensile Testing Machine
   - Manufacturing Processes - 3D Printing, Lazer Cutting
  
  
5. Robotic Car:
   
   Small home project using a RaspberryPi and simple components to create a small controllable car, part of a larger and unfinished project to create a disinfectant powder spreading robot for my Young Farmers Club. Eventually a larger scale vehicle would have been designed and manufactured, this was for proof of concept.
   Skills Developed:
   - Programming - Python
   - CAD - Onshape
   - Basic Eletronics - Sensors, motors and components

7. Recycled Bee House and Recycled Pallet Herb Garden:
   
   I constructed a solitary bee-house out of recycled materials for a Woodoworking Competition, ultimately achieving second place. The end product was donated to a start-up outdoor classroom. For the Eco Club at my secondary school, I designed and created a Herb Planter out of recycled Pallets.
   Skills Developed:
   - Woodworking
