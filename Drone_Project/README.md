The Drone Project

This is a brief overview of the Drone Project for the Professional Engineering Module during my First Year Engineering]

Overview:
- The critical task marked was the iterative improvement of a Drone Arm, producing High-strength and lightweight components
- Manufacturing of the drone arm and the drone itself was also possible, though not required.
- I got as far as designing a 3D model of the drone, however never fully completed manufacturing the entire assembly.

Iterations:
- We were given the 3D assembly of the Drone (HOLLYBRO S500), and given the task to improve components of it to be stronger and lighter.
- I first started with the basic part, and tweaked some parts of it.
- I then reworked the part from the groud up, making it parametric. The motor mount area and where it mounts to the drone was kept the same, though the length of the drone arm could easily be changed.

Further Developments:
- Since one of the requirements of the module was for the components to be printed using PLA on the FlashForge 3D printers, myself and a group of friends used initiative to find a ISO standard plastic tensile testing modle (D638-03) to experiment with different 3D printing parameters.
- Changed Layer Hight (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3) and the infil density (60% and 100%), kept other variables (Print speed, Fan speed etc) the same.
- We found the optimum to be 0.3mm layer hight with 60% infil. This was lighter and held good yield and tensile strength.
- The data gained from this was then fed into the ANSYS FEA simulations, providing more accurate models.

Skills Developed:
- CAD (SOLIDWORKS)
- FEA and CFD (ANSYS Discovery)
- Tensile Testing
- 3D printing
- Lazer cutting
